# number_classification_project

The number classification project uses SVM to identify images of handwritten numbers from 0-9 and classify them correctly.

model.py contains the SVM estimator model used for this project. main.py contains the code to test out and run the classification model. show_img.py is a helper file that can be used to display one of the images from the dataset. mnist_train.py and mnist_test.py are the training and testing data used for this project.
